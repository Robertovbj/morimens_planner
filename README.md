## Development Setup

Before starting development, it's recommended to configure your Git line endings based on your operating system:

### Git Configuration

```bash
# If you're on Windows
git config --global core.autocrlf true

# If you're on Linux or Mac
git config --global core.autocrlf input
```

This ensures consistent line endings across different operating systems when collaborating on the project.

## Contributing

While code contributions are currently not being accepted, we welcome data contributions for higher-level character progression (beyond level 30). This includes:

- Skill upgrade requirements
- Exalt requirements
- Edify requirements

You can submit game data through:
